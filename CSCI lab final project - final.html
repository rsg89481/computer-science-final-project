<p style= "font-family: verdana;"> The amount of cigarette butts found actually decreased from 2009 to 2017. </p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;">
Three million premature deaths
are linked to cigarette use caused diseases each year. <br>
However, something that isnâ€™t as widely covered is the 
environmental impact cigarettes have.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana;"> Cigarettes are the number one most littered item in America. <br>
In 2009, during the annual International Coastal Cleanup,
Ocean Conservancy found that about <br> 
3,216,991 cigarettes or cigarette buts were collected from beaches 
and inland waterways all over the world.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana;"> Cigarettes butts are not biodegradable and are made of cellulose acetate (a natural plastic). 
<br> They break down enough to meet most cities toxic waste guidelines but will never full decompose. 
<br> Cigarette butts can leach out toxic chemicals, like arsenic and lead, into the environment which 
can contaminate <br> water and vegetation. Contaminated water can poison fish and cigarette butts have 
been linked to contaminated <br> vegetation which can and has affected the lives of livestock. 
In addition, they can kill small animals if ingested. <br> There has even been cases where small 
children have picked up discarded cigarettes and ingested them, <br> 
leading them to become ill. As society advances and grows,  
we should all try our hardest to help minimize the <br> detrimental impact we create every day on the earth.</p>
